#ZlykhSLAM

A basic implementation of SLAM

To Run
-----

* Requires a video to run SLAM on, this implementaiton is just for learning this is a python based SLAM so it isn't efficient
* Just provide it the video with runing slam.py file

Usage:
-----

'''
REVERSE=1 F=270 D2D=1 D3D=1 ./slam.py <video.mp4>
'''


Parameters (args)
----- 

the script can be run with the following args: i.e F=300 D2D=1 D3D=1 ./slam.py videos/test_ohio.mp4
* F=270 will set the focus length to 270 for the camera
* D2D=1 will enable 2d Display
* D3D=1 will enable 3d Display
* REVERSE=1 will enable reverse video mode (must provide a video that's running in reverse)



TODO:
-----

* Add Optimizer for F
* Replace essential matrix for pose estimation once we have a track
 * Add kinematic model
 * Run g2o to only optimize the latest pose
* Add search by projection o re-find old map points
 * Check if points are in the field of view of the camera
* Improve init to not need REVERSE environment variable
* Add multiscale feature extractor
