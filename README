#ZlykhSLAM

A basic implementation of SLAM

## Uses
* sdl2 to display video
* cv2 for feature tracking and matching
* g2opy for optimization
* skimage for ransac and EssentialMatrixTransform


## To Run
* Requires a video to run SLAM on, this implementaiton is just for learning this is a python based SLAM so it isn't efficient
* Just change the videoFromDir var in slam.py file, currently using a car driving video
