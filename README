#ZlykhSLAM

A basic implementation of SLAM

## Uses
* sdl2 for 2-D display
* cv2 for feature tracking and matching
* g2opy for optimization
* skimage for ransac and EssentialMatrixTransform
* pypangolin for 3-D display

## To Run
* Requires a video to run SLAM on, this implementaiton is just for learning this is a python based SLAM so it isn't efficient
* Just provide it the video with runing slam.py file

## Parameters (args)
the script can be run with the following args: i.e F=300 D2D=1 D3D=1 ./slam.py videos/test_ohio.mp4
* F=300 will set the focus length to 300 for the camera
* D2D=1 will enable 2d Display
* D3D=1 will enable 3d Display

TODO:
* Add Optimizer for F
* Replace essential matrix for pose estimation once we have a track
** Add kinematic model
** Run g2o to only optimize the latest pose
* Add search by projection o re-find old map points
** Check if points are in the field of view of the camera
* Improve init to not need REVERSE environment variable
